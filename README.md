- 👋 Hi, I’m @FarzanaAdiba
- 👀 I’m interested in Advanced Natural Language Processing to solve real-world problems and enhance fairness.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on Natural Language Processing with Large Language Models in Healthcare.
   I’m looking to collaborate on NLP, LLM, and Machine Learning Projects, even though I am interested in multilingual NLP problems.
- 📫 You can find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/farzana-islam-adiba-19695615a/
